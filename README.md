# LaTeX template for the STAB&S 2021 conference

This is a work in progress. Almost everything is functional, but come back for updates nonetheless.

To use, drop the class file and the logo next to your LaTeX sources. Compile with pdfLaTeX and BibTeX. See example files `template.tex` and `bibtex.bib`.
